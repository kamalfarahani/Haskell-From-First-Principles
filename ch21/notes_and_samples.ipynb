    "The `Traversable` type class in Haskell is one of the most powerful and elegant abstractions in functional programming. It generalizes the idea of iterating over a data structure, running an **effect** (an `Applicative` action) on each element, and then rebuilding the structure with the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "While `Functor` allows you to modify values and `Foldable` allows you to squash values, `Traversable` allows you to **preserve the shape** of the data while processing the effects associated with the elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "The definition can be found in `Data.Traversable`. To be a `Traversable`, a type must already be a `Functor` and a `Foldable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Formal Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "class (Functor t, Foldable t) => Traversable t where\n",
    "    -- | Map each element of a structure to an action, \n",
    "    -- evaluate these actions from left to right, and collect the results.\n",
    "    traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)\n",
    "    traverse f = sequenceA . fmap f\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- | Evaluate each action in the structure from left to right, \n",
    "    -- and collect the results.\n",
    "    sequenceA :: Applicative f => t (f a) -> f (t a)\n",
    "    sequenceA = ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Map-like versions (historical/specialized)\n",
    "    mapM :: Monad m => (a -> m b) -> t a -> m (t b)\n",
    "    mapM = traverse\n",
    "\n",
    "    sequence :: Monad m => t (m a) -> m (t a)\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Requirements & Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`traverse`**: This is the most frequently used method. It takes a function that produces an effect (like `a -> Maybe b` or `a -> IO b`) and applies it to every element in the structure. It then \"sequences\" those effects together.\n",
    "2. **`sequenceA`**: This is used when the effects are already inside the structure (e.g., `[Just 1, Just 2]`). It pulls the effect layer out to the front (`Just [1, 2]`).\n",
    "3. **Minimal Complete Definition**: To create an instance of `Traversable`, you must implement **either** `traverse` or `sequenceA`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Laws\n",
    "\n",
    "For a `Traversable` instance to be valid, it must satisfy three laws for `traverse` that ensure the structure is preserved and the effects are handled predictably:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identity:** `traverse Identity = Identity`\n",
    "    * Mapping the `Identity` constructor over a structure should change nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Composition:** `traverse (Compose . fmap g . f) = Compose . fmap (traverse g) . traverse f`\n",
    "    * Traversing two functions one after the other is the same as traversing their composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Naturality:** `t . traverse f = traverse (t . f)`\n",
    "    * This ensures that changing the effect type (via a natural transformation `t`) doesn't change the way the structure is traversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively the `sequenceA` function must satisfy the following laws:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identity:** `sequenceA . fmap Identity = Identity`\n",
    "2. **Composition:**  `sequenceA . fmap Compose = Compose . fmap sequenceA . sequenceA`\n",
    "3. **Naturality:** `t . sequenceA = sequenceA . fmap t`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are defining your own instance of `Traversable`, your implementation of `sequenceA` must satisfy these rules. If it doesn't, other Haskell libraries (which assume these laws are true) might produce bugs when using your data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Would you like to see a code example of how the Composition law looks with actual types like `Maybe` and `[]`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The `sequenceA` Function: Turning Structures Inside-Out\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand `Traversable`, it is often easiest to start with `sequenceA`. Its primary job is to flip two contexts (layers of types). It turns a \"structure of actions\" into an \"action that returns a structure.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Type Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break this down:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Input:** `t (f a)` — A Traversable structure `t` (like a List) containing Applicative effects `f` (like `Maybe` or `IO`).\n",
    "* **Output:** `f (t a)` — The Applicative effect `f` is now on the outside, wrapping the structure `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intuition: The \"Inside-Out\" Flip\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a **List** of **Maybe** integers: `[Just 1, Just 2, Just 3]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The type is `[Maybe Int]` (List of Maybes).\n",
    "* If you want to ensure *all* elements exist before processing the list, you want to turn this into `Maybe [Int]` (Maybe a List).\n",
    "\n",
    "If any element is `Nothing`, the whole result becomes `Nothing`. If all are `Just`, you get `Just [1, 2, 3]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "ghci> sequenceA [Just 1, Just 2, Just 3]\n",
    "Just [1,2,3]\n",
    "\n",
    "ghci> sequenceA [Just 1, Nothing, Just 3]\n",
    "Nothing\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `sequenceA` collected the effects (the `Maybe` context) and pulled them to the outer level.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Defining `traverse` using `sequenceA`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `traverse` function is the heart of the `Traversable` type class. It combines mapping and sequencing into a single step.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, per your request, we can define `traverse` by composing `fmap` and `sequenceA`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Or in Haskell code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "traverse :: (Traversable t, Applicative f) => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)\n",
    "traverse f xs = sequenceA (fmap f xs)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it works (Step-by-Step)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's trace the types to see how this composition achieves the goal of `traverse`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Goal:** We start with `t a` and a function `(a -> f b)`. We want to end up with `f (t b)`.\n",
    "2. **Step 1 (`fmap f`):**\n",
    "* We apply the function `f` to every element inside the structure `t`.\n",
    "* This transforms `t a` into `t (f b)`.\n",
    "* Now we have a structure where every element is wrapped in an effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Step 2 (`sequenceA`):**\n",
    "* We take the result from step 1, which is `t (f b)`.\n",
    "* We apply `sequenceA`, which flips the layers.\n",
    "* This transforms `t (f b)` into `f (t b)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualizing the Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a function `check :: Int -> Maybe Int` that returns `Nothing` if a number is odd, and `Just n` if it is even. We want to traverse a list `[2, 4]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start:** `[2, 4]`\n",
    "2. **`fmap check`:** `[Just 2, Just 4]` (We now have a List of Maybes)\n",
    "3. **`sequenceA`:** `Just [2, 4]` (We now have a Maybe List)\n",

    "### 2. Implementing the Traversable Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "To make `Tree` traversable, we implement `traverse`. Notice how the implementation looks almost exactly like `fmap`, but we use the Applicative **`ficiton` operator (`<*>`)** and **`pure`** to rebuild the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "instance Traversable Tree where\n",
    "    -- traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> Tree a -> f (Tree b)\n",

    "### 3. Concrete Example: Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a tree of integers, and you want to ensure **all** numbers are even. If any number is odd, the whole operation should fail (return `Nothing`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Setup\n",

    "```haskell\n",
    "-- A function that returns an effect (Maybe)\n",
    "ensureEven :: Int -> Maybe Int\n",

    "invalidTree = Node (Node Leaf 2 Leaf) 3 (Node Leaf 6 Leaf)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Result\n",
    "\n",
    "When we `traverse` the tree with `ensureEven`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "ghci> traverse ensureEven validTree\n",
    "Just (Node (Node Leaf 2 Leaf) 4 (Node Leaf 6 Leaf))\n",
    "\n",
    "ghci> traverse ensureEven invalidTree\n",
    "Nothing\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happened here?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `traverse` walked the tree.\n",
    "* It applied `ensureEven` to every node.\n",
    "* It collected all the `Just` values and rebuilt the **exact same tree shape** inside a single `Just`.\n",
    "* Because `invalidTree` had a `3`, that specific node returned `Nothing`, which caused the entire result to become `Nothing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Concrete Example: Using `sequenceA`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have a tree where the nodes are already wrapped in effects (e.g., `Tree (IO Int)`), you use `sequenceA` to \"run\" the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why this is better than a List\n",
    "\n",
    "With a List, it's easy to think `traverse` is just \"mapping and flattening.\" But with a **Tree**, you see that the **structure is sacred**. `Traversable` guarantees that if you start with a Tree, you end with a Tree—never a List or a single value—while allowing the effects (like `Maybe`, `IO`, or `Either`) to determine if the final structure is even created."
