    "# Reader\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Reader pattern** is a way of stringing functions together when those functions are all **awaiting a shared input from a common environment**. In application development, programmers often need to pass around information that is required intermittently or universally, such as configuration data or a database connection. Instead of passing this information as an explicit argument to almost every function—which makes code harder to read and maintain—the Reader pattern allows this \"read-only\" environment to be shared implicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Intuition and Motivation\n",
    "The core intuition behind Reader is that it provides a way to **abstract out function application**, allowing you to perform computation in terms of an argument that has not yet been supplied. It is particularly useful for:\n",
    "*   **Avoiding \"argument clutter\":** It prevents the type of every function from being dominated by a universal environment argument.\n",
    "*   **Constant values:** It is most often used when a constant value obtained from outside the program needs to be used by a wide variety of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Foundation\n",
    "The Reader pattern is built upon the fact that **partially applied functions**—specifically the type `(->) r`—already possess **Functor, Applicative, and Monad instances**. \n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Functor of functions:** When you `fmap` a function over another, it is identical to **function composition**. The structure being lifted over is the argument type `r`, and the value being transformed is the result of the function.\n",
    "*   **Applicative of functions:** This context allows you to pass a **single shared argument to multiple functions in parallel** and then combine their results. This is often used when two functions share the same input and you want to apply a third function to their results to reach a final value.\n",
    "*   **Monad of functions:** The Monad instance allows for **chaining functions** that all wait for the same environment. Using `do` syntax with functions allows you to bind variables to the eventual results of those functions once the shared input is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Reader Type\n",
    "While the pattern can be used with raw functions, Haskell provides a specific **newtype wrapper** for clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "newtype Reader r a = Reader { runReader :: r -> a }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this definition, **`r` represents the environment type** being \"read,\" and **`a` is the result type** of the computation. The `runReader` accessor is used to extract the underlying function from the wrapper so it can be applied to an environment value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Usage\n",
    "In production Haskell code, you will more commonly encounter **`ReaderT`**, which is the **monad transformer** version of Reader. Reader rarely stands alone; it is typically part of a \"stack\" of monads (such as combining Reader, Either, and IO) to provide a robust environment that handles shared state, error catching, and input/output simultaneously."

    "## Monad Reader\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Monad instance for Reader** is a way of chaining functions that are all **awaiting a single shared input from a common environment**. It allows you to perform computations in terms of an argument that has not yet been supplied, effectively abstracting out function application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Technical Structure\n",
    "In the context of the Reader pattern, the monadic structure `m` is the **partially applied function type `((->) r)`**, where `r` is the environment being \"read\". When we specialize the Monad methods for this type, they look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`return :: a -> r -> a`**: This is identical to the `const` function; it takes a value and creates a function that ignores the environment and returns that value.\n",
    "*   **`(>>=) :: (r -> a) -> (a -> r -> b) -> (r -> b)`**: The bind operator takes a function awaiting an `r`, and a second function that produces a new Reader computation. It pipes the shared argument `r` through the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of bind for functions can be summarized as:\n",
    "`f >>= k = \\r -> k (f r) r`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of the Reader Monad\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Basic `do` Syntax with Arithmetic\n",
    "Consider two functions, `boop = (*2)` and `doop = (+10)`. We can combine them using the Reader Monad so they both receive the same input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "boopDoop :: Integer -> Integer\n",
    "boopDoop = do\n",
    "  a <- boop    -- a is the result of (input * 2)\n",
    "  b <- doop    -- b is the result of (input + 10)\n",
    "  return (a + b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, as soon as an input is provided to `boopDoop`, it fills the empty slots in both `boop` and `doop`. The results are bound to `a` and `b`, then added together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Building Records from a Shared Environment\n",
    "The Reader Monad is often used to extract multiple pieces of information from a single complex record. Imagine we have a `Person` and we want to create a `Dog` using the person's data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "getDogRM :: Person -> Dog\n",
    "getDogRM = do\n",
    "  name <- dogName    -- dogName is a function: Person -> DogName\n",
    "  addy <- address    -- address is a function: Person -> Address\n",
    "  return $ Dog name addy\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `dogName` and `address` are functions \"reading\" from the same `Person` environment. The Monad instance handles passing the `Person` argument to both functions behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Abstracting Function Application\n",
    "A more abstract example shows how `bind` works under the hood to combine two functions, `foo` and `bar`, that are waiting for the same argument `r`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "frooty' :: Num a => [a] -> ([a], Int)\n",
    "frooty' = \\r -> bar (foo r) r\n",
    "```\n",
    "This pattern is exactly what `bind` (or `fooBind` in the sources) generalizes: it takes an environment `r`, applies the first function to it, and then passes both the result and the original `r` to the next function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Utility\n",
    "The Reader Monad is most useful when you have a **constant value** (like a configuration or database connection) obtained from outside the program that needs to be an argument to a large number of functions. Using the Monad instance allows you to **avoid passing that argument explicitly** to every single function call."
