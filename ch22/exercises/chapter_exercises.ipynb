    "\n",
    "These exercises are designed to be a warm-up and get you using\n",
    "some of the stuﬀ we’ve learned in the last few chapters. While these\n",
    "exercises comprise code fragments from real code, they are simplified in order to be discrete exercises. That will allow us to highlight\n",
    "and practice some of the type manipulation from Traversable and\n",
    "`Reader`, both of which are tricky.\n",
    "The first simplified part is that we’re going to set up some toy\n",
    "data; in the real programs these are taken from, the data is coming\n",
    "from somewhere else — a database, for example. We just need\n",
    "some lists of numbers. We’re going to use some functions from\n",
    "`Control.Applicative` and `Data.Maybe`, so we’ll import those at the top of\n",
    "our practice file. We’ll call our lists of toy data by common variable\n",
    "names for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "import Control.Applicative\n",
    "import Data.Maybe\n",

    "x = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "y = [4, 5, 6]\n",
    "z = [7, 8, 9]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing we want to do is write some functions that zip\n",
    "those lists together and use lookup to find the value associated with\n",
    "a specified key in our zipped lists. For demonstration purposes, it’s\n",
    "nice to have the outputs be predictable, so we recommend writing\n",
    "some that are concrete values, as well as one that can be applied to a\n",
    "variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "lookup :: Eq a => a -> [(a, b)] -> Maybe b\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we’re going to make some helper functions. Let’s use uncurry\n",
    "to allow us to add the two values that are inside a tuple:\n",

    "```haskell\n",
    "uncurry :: (a -> b -> c) -> (a, b) -> c\n",
    "-- that first argument is a function\n",
