    "**Functors in Haskell**\n",
    "\n",
    "A functor is a type constructor that can be mapped over. It's a way to abstract over the concept of applying a function to all elements within a container, while preserving the container's structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type Constructor:** A functor is a type that takes one type parameter (e.g., `List`, `Maybe`).\n",
    "- **Mapping:** The core operation is `fmap`, which applies a function to the values inside the functor.\n",
    "- **Structure Preservation:** The functor's structure remains unchanged after mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: List Functor**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common example is the list. A list is a functor because we can apply a function to all elements using `map`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "-- Define a function to double a number\n",
    "double x = x * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "-- A list of numbers\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Map the `double` function over the list\n",
    "doubledNumbers = map double numbers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `map` is essentially `fmap` for lists. It applies `double` to each element, producing a new list with the doubled values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functor Laws**\n",
    "\n",
    "To be a valid functor, a type must satisfy two laws:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identity Law:** `fmap id = id`\n",
    "   - Applying the identity function (`id x = x`) using `fmap` should have no effect.\n",
    "2. **Composition Law:** `fmap (f . g) = fmap f . fmap g`\n",
    "   - Applying the composition of two functions using `fmap` is equivalent to applying `fmap` twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom Functor**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create custom functors by defining a type and implementing the `fmap` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "data Maybe' a = Nothing' | Just' a\n",
    "\n",
    "instance Functor Maybe' where\n",
    "  fmap _ Nothing'  = Nothing'\n",
    "  fmap f (Just' x) = Just' (f x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `Maybe'` is a custom Maybe type with a different constructor syntax. We define the `fmap` function to handle both `Nothing'` and `Just'` cases, applying the function only to the value wrapped in `Just'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Functor Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Maybe`: Represents optional values.\n",
    "- `Either`: Represents values with two possible types.\n",
    "- `Tree`: A tree structure.\n",
    "- `IO`: Represents actions with side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Functors provide a powerful abstraction for working with different data structures in a consistent way. Understanding functors is crucial for mastering functional programming in Haskell and other languages.\n"

    "### Functor Laws\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, a **functor** is a type class that represents types that can be mapped over. The key feature of a functor is the `fmap` function, which applies a function to the values wrapped in a functor.\n",
    "\n",
    "A functor must satisfy two laws: the **identity law** and the **composition law**. Let's break these down with explanations and examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identity Law**\n",
    "   - This law states that if you apply the `fmap` function with the identity function (`id`), the result should be the same as the original functor.\n",
    "   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     fmap id == id\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```haskell\n",
    "   import Data.Maybe\n",
    "\n",
    "   -- Original value wrapped in a Maybe functor\n",
    "   let x = Just 5\n",
    "\n",
    "   -- Applying fmap with the identity function\n",
    "   fmap id x  -- Result: Just 5\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, applying `fmap id` to `Just 5` results in `Just 5`, satisfying the identity law.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Composition Law**\n",
    "   - This law states that if you have two functions, `f` and `g`, and you apply `fmap` to them in composition, it should be equivalent to applying `fmap` for each function in sequence.\n",
    "   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     fmap (f . g) == fmap f . fmap g\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```haskell\n",
    "   import Data.Maybe\n",
    "\n",
    "   -- Two functions\n",
    "   let f x = x + 1\n",
    "   let g x = x * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "   -- Original value\n",
    "   let x = Just 5\n",
    "\n",
    "   -- Applying fmap with composition\n",
    "   fmap (f . g) x  -- Result: Just 11 (because (5 * 2) + 1 = 11)\n",
    "\n",
    "   -- Applying fmap separately\n",
    "   let y = fmap g x  -- Result: Just 10\n",
    "   let z = fmap f y  -- Result: Just 11\n",
    "\n",
    "   -- Verifying the composition law\n",
    "   fmap (f . g) x == (fmap f . fmap g) x  -- Result: True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, both methods give the same result (`Just 11`), thus satisfying the composition law.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a functor in Haskell is a type that implements the `fmap` function, and it must satisfy the following laws:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identity Law**: Applying `fmap` with the identity function returns the original functor.\n",
    "- **Composition Law**: Applying `fmap` with a composed function is the same as applying `fmap` to each function in sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "These laws ensure that functors behave predictably and consistently when manipulating values within them."
