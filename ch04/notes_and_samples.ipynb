    "## Basic datatypes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining datatypes\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, you can define custom data types using the `data` keyword. The `data` keyword is used to create algebraic data types, which can have one or more constructors. Each constructor can have zero or more arguments. Here's the basic syntax for defining a data type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "data TypeName = Constructor1 [Type1] [Type2] ... | Constructor2 [Type3] [Type4] ... | ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `TypeName` is the name you give to your custom data type.\n",
    "- `Constructor1`, `Constructor2`, etc., are the names of the constructors for your data type. You can have multiple constructors separated by `|`.\n",
    "- `[Type1]`, `[Type2]`, etc., are the types of the arguments for each constructor. You can have zero or more arguments for each constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of defining a data type called `Color` with two constructors:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "data Color = Red | Green | Blue | RGB Int Int Int\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Color` is the name of the data type.\n",
    "- `Red`, `Green`, and `Blue` are constructors without any arguments.\n",
    "- `RGB` is a constructor with three `Int` arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create values of your custom data type by using the constructors. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "redColor :: Color\n",
    "redColor = Red\n",
    "\n",
    "rgbColor :: Color\n",
    "rgbColor = RGB 255 0 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a value `redColor` of type `Color` using the `Red` constructor, and a value `rgbColor` of type `Color` using the `RGB` constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pattern match on data type values using the `case` expression or defining functions with pattern matching. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "colorToString :: Color -> String\n",
    "colorToString color = case color of\n",
    "  Red -> \"Red\"\n",
    "  Green -> \"Green\"\n",
    "  Blue -> \"Blue\"\n",
    "  RGB r g b -> \"RGB(\" ++ show r ++ \", \" ++ show g ++ \", \" ++ show b ++ \")\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `colorToString` function pattern matches on the `Color` argument and returns a string representation of the color. The `RGB` constructor allows us to access the individual `Int` components of the color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining custom data types allows you to create structured data that accurately represents the domain of your application. You can then use pattern matching and functions to work with the data in a type-safe manner."

    "### Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integral numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, there are several integral number types available. Integral types are those that represent whole numbers without fractional parts. The main integral types in Haskell are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`Int`**: This is a fixed-size signed integer type. Its size is platform-dependent, but it is typically 32 or 64 bits. It is commonly used for general-purpose integer arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`Integer`**: This type represents arbitrary-precision integers. It can represent integers of any size, limited only by available memory. However, operations on `Integer` may be slower compared to fixed-size types like `Int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`Word`**: This is an unsigned integer type. It has the same size as `Int` on a given platform, but it can only represent non-negative numbers. It is often used when working with bitwise operations or when you need to ensure that a number is always positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`**: These are fixed-size signed integer types with sizes of 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits, respectively. They are useful when you need to work with numbers of specific sizes or when you want to conserve memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`Word8`, `Word16`, `Word32`, `Word64`**: These are fixed-size unsigned integer types with sizes of 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits, respectively. They are similar to their signed counterparts but can only represent non-negative numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing an integral type, consider the range of values you need to represent and the performance characteristics of the operations you'll be performing. If you need to represent very large integers or if you're unsure about the size requirements, `Integer` is a good choice. Otherwise, the fixed-size types like `Int` or the `Int32`/`Int64` family should be sufficient for most use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fractional numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, fractional number types represent numbers with a fractional part, such as decimal numbers. The main fractional types in Haskell are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`Float`**: This is a single-precision floating-point type. It is a binary-based representation that can store fractional numbers with a limited precision. It is typically 32 bits in size and can represent a wide range of values, but it may suffer from rounding errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`Double`**: This is a double-precision floating-point type. It is similar to `Float`, but with higher precision. It is typically 64 bits in size and provides greater accuracy compared to `Float`, but it also suffers from rounding errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`Rational`**: This type represents rational numbers as a ratio of two integers. It provides exact representation of fractions without any loss of precision. For example, the rational number 1/3 is represented as the ratio of the integers 1 and 3. However, operations on `Rational` numbers may be slower compared to floating-point types.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`Fixed`**: This type is part of the `fixed` library, which provides fixed-point arithmetic. It represents fixed-point numbers with a specified number of decimal places. It offers precise control over decimal precision and avoids rounding errors associated with floating-point types.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`Scientific`**: The `Scientific` type is a numeric type provided by the scientific library in Haskell. It is designed to represent arbitrary-precision decimal numbers with efficient storage and arithmetic operations. The Scientific type is useful when you need to work with decimal numbers with a high degree of precision and avoid rounding errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing a fractional type, consider the required precision and the trade-off between accuracy and performance. If you need high precision and exact representation of fractions, `Rational` is a good choice. If you need efficient computation with approximate values, `Float` and `Double` are commonly used. If you need precise control over decimal precision, you can consider using the `Fixed` type from the `fixed` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Num` type class\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, the `Num` type class is a built-in type class that represents numeric types. It provides a set of operations and functions that can be used with numeric values. The `Num` type class is a superclass of several other numeric type classes, such as `Integral`, `Fractional`, and `Floating`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Num` type class defines the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Addition** (`+`): It takes two values of the same type and returns their sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subtraction** (`-`): It takes two values of the same type and returns their difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiplication** (`*`): It takes two values of the same type and returns their product.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Negation** (`negate`): It takes a single value and returns its negation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Absolute value** (`abs`): It takes a single value and returns its absolute value.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Sign of a number** (`signum`): It takes a single value and returns its sign (-1 for negative, 0 for zero, and 1 for positive).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Num` type class doesn't define division because not all numeric types support division. For division, you would need to use the `Fractional` type class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of defining an instance of the `Num` type class for a custom data type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "data MyNumber = MyInt Int | MyDouble Double\n",
    "\n",
    "instance Num MyNumber where\n",
    "    MyInt x + MyInt y = MyInt (x + y)\n",
    "    MyDouble x + MyDouble y = MyDouble (x + y)\n",
    "    -- Define the rest of the operations similarly\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- You need to define other operations as well, such as *, -, negate, abs, and signum\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the `Num` instance for the `MyNumber` type allows you to use the `+` operator to add two `MyNumber` values together. The implementation for other operations can be defined similarly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Bounded` type class\n",
    "You can find out the minimum and maximum bounds of numeric types using maxBound and minBound from the Bounded typeclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "class Bounded a where\n",
    "  minBound :: a\n",
    "  maxBound :: a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example using our Int8 and Int16 example:"

    "\n",
    "In Haskell, the `if-else` expression is a way to conditionally execute code based on a Boolean condition. It has the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "if condition\n",
    "  then expression1\n",
    "  else expression2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `condition` is an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value (`True` or `False`). If the `condition` evaluates to `True`, then `expression1` is executed. Otherwise, if the `condition` evaluates to `False`, then `expression2` is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `if-else` expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "isEven :: Integer -> String\n",
    "isEven n = if n `mod` 2 == 0\n",
    "              then \"Even\"\n",
    "              else \"Odd\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `isEven` function takes an `Int` argument `n` and uses the `if-else` expression to check if `n` is even. If `n` is divisible by 2 (i.e., `n % 2 == 0`), the `if` branch is executed and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the `else` branch is executed and the function returns `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `isEven` function to check if a number is even:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "main :: IO ()\n",
    "main = do\n",
    "  putStrLn $ show (isEven 4)  -- Output: Even\n",
    "  putStrLn $ show (isEven 7)  -- Output: Odd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `isEven` is called with the arguments `4` and `7`. The results are printed to the console using `putStrLn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in Haskell, the `if-else` expression is an expression, not a statement. This means that it always returns a value, and both `expression1` and `expression2` must have the same type. Therefore, you cannot omit the `else` branch like you can in some other programming languages."

    "### Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, a tuple is a composite data type that allows you to group together a fixed number of values of possibly different types into a single value. Tuples are defined using parentheses and comma-separated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of a tuple is determined by the types of its elements. For example, a tuple containing an `Int` and a `String` would have the type `(Int, String)`. Tuples can have different lengths and can contain elements of different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "tuple1 :: (Int, String)\n",
    "tuple1 = (42, \"Hello\")\n",
    "\n",
    "tuple2 :: (Double, Char, Bool)\n",
    "tuple2 = (3.14, 'A', True)\n",
    "\n",
    "tuple3 :: (String, Bool, Int, Char)\n",
    "tuple3 = (\"Haskell\", False, 42, 'X')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In these examples, `tuple1` is a tuple of type `(Int, String)` containing an `Int` value (`42`) and a `String` value (`\"Hello\"`). `tuple2` is a tuple of type `(Double, Char, Bool)` containing a `Double` value (`3.14`), a `Char` value (`'A'`), and a `Bool` value (`True`). `tuple3` is a tuple of type `(String, Bool, Int, Char)` containing a `String` value (`\"Haskell\"`), a `Bool` value (`False`), an `Int` value (`42`), and a `Char` value (`'X'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the elements of a tuple using pattern matching or the `fst` and `snd` functions for tuples with two elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates accessing tuple elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "getTupleElements :: (Int, String) -> (Int, String)\n",
    "getTupleElements tuple = (fst tuple + 1, snd tuple ++ \" World\")\n",
    "\n",
    "main :: IO ()\n",
    "main = do\n",
    "  let tuple = (42, \"Hello\")\n",
    "  let modifiedTuple = getTupleElements tuple\n",
    "  putStrLn $ show modifiedTuple\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `getTupleElements` function takes a tuple of type `(Int, String)` and returns a modified tuple where the first element is incremented by 1 and the second element has \" World\" appended to it. The `main` function creates a tuple `(42, \"Hello\")`, applies the `getTupleElements` function to it, and prints the resulting tuple to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this code will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(43,\"Hello World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are a useful construct in Haskell for grouping related values together when the number and types of the values are known at compile-time. They provide a lightweight way to create composite values without defining custom data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `fst` and `snd`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fst` and `snd` functions are used to extract the first and second elements, respectively, from a tuple. These functions are specifically designed to work with tuples that have exactly two elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fst` function takes a tuple as an argument and returns its first element. Similarly, the `snd` function takes a tuple as an argument and returns its second element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `fst` and `snd`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "tuple :: (Int, String)\n",
    "tuple = (42, \"Hello\")\n",
    "\n",
    "main :: IO ()\n",
    "main = do\n",
    "  let firstElement = fst tuple\n",
    "  let secondElement = snd tuple\n",
    "  putStrLn $ \"First element: \" ++ show firstElement\n",
    "  putStrLn $ \"Second element: \" ++ secondElement\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have a tuple of type `(Int, String)` named `tuple` containing an `Int` value (`42`) and a `String` value (`\"Hello\"`). The `fst` function is used to extract the first element (`42`) and assign it to the `firstElement` variable. The `snd` function is used to extract the second element (`\"Hello\"`) and assign it to the `secondElement` variable. Finally, the values of `firstElement` and `secondElement` are printed to the console using `putStrLn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this code will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "First element: 42\n",
    "Second element: Hello\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the `fst` and `snd` functions are specific to tuples with two elements. If you try to use them with tuples of different sizes, or with types other than tuples, a compile-time error will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples and the `fst` and `snd` functions provide a convenient way to work with pairs of values in Haskell, especially when the number of elements is fixed and known at compile-time."
