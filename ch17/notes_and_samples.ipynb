    "### Applicative definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, the `Applicative` type class is a powerful abstraction that allows you to apply functions wrapped in a context (like a `Maybe`, `List`, or `IO`) to values that are also wrapped in a context. It builds on the `Functor` type class, and provides a way to handle functions that take multiple arguments in a context-aware manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Functor**: The `Applicative` type class is a subclass of `Functor`. This means that any type that is an instance of `Applicative` must also implement `fmap`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **pure**: This function takes a value and wraps it in the applicative context.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **(<*> or ap)**: This operator takes a wrapped function and a wrapped value and applies the function to the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Type Class Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a simplified definition of the `Applicative` type class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "class Functor f => Applicative f where\n",
    "    pure :: a -> f a\n",
    "    (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: `Maybe`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Maybe` type is a common instance of `Applicative`. It represents a computation that might fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "-- Using pure to wrap a value\n",
    "justFive :: Maybe Int\n",
    "justFive = pure 5  -- Result: Just 5\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Applying a function wrapped in Maybe\n",
    "add :: Int -> Int -> Int\n",
    "add x y = x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "maybeAdd :: Maybe (Int -> Int)\n",
    "maybeAdd = pure add\n",
    "\n",
    "result :: Maybe Int\n",
    "result = maybeAdd <*> Just 3 <*> Just 4  -- Result: Just 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are also instances of `Applicative`. The `(<*>)` operator applies functions in a list to values in another list, producing all combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "-- Pure to wrap a value in a list\n",
    "pureList :: [Int]\n",
    "pureList = pure 5  -- Result: [5]\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Using a list of functions\n",
    "addLists :: [Int -> Int]\n",
    "addLists = [(+1), (+2)]\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Combining lists\n",
    "resultList :: [Int]\n",
    "resultList = addLists <*> [1, 2, 3]  -- Result: [2,3,4,3,4,5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: `IO`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `IO` type is also an instance of `Applicative`, allowing you to combine actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "-- Pure to wrap a value in IO\n",
    "pureIO :: IO Int\n",
    "pureIO = pure 5  -- Result: an IO action that produces 5\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Combining IO actions\n",
    "printSum :: IO ()\n",
    "printSum = (+) <$> getLine <*> getLine >>= print\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Applicative` allows you to apply functions in a context to values in a context.\n",
    "- It is a generalization of `Functor` and provides more functionality.\n",
    "- Common instances include `Maybe`, lists, and `IO`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using `Applicative`, you can elegantly handle computations that may involve multiple contexts, making your Haskell code more concise and expressive."
