    "Folds are a powerful concept in Haskell that allow you to process a `Foldable` and reduce it to a single value. There are two main fold functions: `foldl` and `foldr`. Both take a function, a starting value (accumulator), and a foldable as arguments. They differ in the order they apply the function to the elements of the foldable."

    "### `foldr`\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is `foldr`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "`foldr` is a powerful function in Haskell's `Data.Foldable` class that allows you to \"fold\" a list (or any foldable structure) from right to left, applying a binary function to each element and an accumulator value. It accumulates a single result based on the function and the list elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Signature and Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "foldr :: Foldable t => (a -> b -> b) -> b -> t a -> b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `(a -> b -> b)`: This represents the binary function you'll use. It takes two arguments:\n",
    "    - `a`: The current element being processed from the list.\n",
    "    - `b`: The accumulator value, which holds the result of the previous fold operations.\n",
    "- `b`: This is the initial accumulator value you provide, used as the starting point for the folding process.\n",
    "- `t a`: This represents the type of the foldable structure. In most cases, it'll be a list `[a]`. `foldr` works with various foldable structures like lists, strings, trees, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`foldr` iterates through the list from right to left. In each iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It takes the last element (`a`) and the current accumulator value (`b`).\n",
    "2. It applies the provided binary function (`(a -> b -> b)`) to these two values.\n",
    "3. The result of the function call becomes the new accumulator value (`b`) for the next iteration.\n",
    "4. This process repeats until the entire list is processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Right-to-Left:** `foldr` starts with the last element and works its way towards the first, unlike `foldl` which starts from the first element.\n",
    "- **Accumulator:** The accumulator value accumulates the result of applying the function to each element.\n",
    "- **Empty List:** If the list is empty (`[]`), `foldr` simply returns the initial accumulator value (`b`) you provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Summing a List:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```haskell\n",
    "   sum xs = foldr (+) 0 xs\n",
    "\n",
    "   sum [1, 2, 3, 4]  -- Output: 10\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, `(+)` is the binary function that adds two numbers. It's applied to each element and the accumulator, accumulating the sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reversing a List:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```haskell\n",
    "   reverse xs = foldr (\\x xs -> xs ++ [x]) [] xs\n",
    "\n",
    "   reverse [1, 2, 3, 4]  -- Output: [4,3,2,1]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the function `(\\x xs -> xs ++ [x])` prepends the current element (`x`) to the existing accumulator (`xs`), which is initially an empty list (`[]`). This effectively builds a new list in reverse order.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Concatenating Strings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```haskell\n",
    "   concatWords xs = foldr (++) \"\" xs\n",
    "\n",
    "   concatWords [\"hello\", \" \", \"world\"]  -- Output: \"hello world\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, `(++)` is used to concatenate strings. The empty string (`\"\"`) is the initial accumulator, and each word is appended to it using `(++)` in the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Custom Logic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```haskell\n",
    "   filterEven xs = foldr (\\x acc -> if even x then x : acc else acc) [] xs\n",
    "\n",
    "   filterEven [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  -- Output: [2, 4]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This example defines a custom function that checks if an element is even and adds it to the accumulator (`acc`) if it is. This effectively filters out odd numbers from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "foldr _ y [] = y\n",
    "foldr f y (x:xs) = f x (foldr f y xs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**In Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`foldr` is a versatile function that allows for concise and efficient manipulation of foldable structures in Haskell. By understanding its right-to-left folding approach and the role of the accumulator, you can write elegant code to achieve various tasks like summing, reversing, filtering, and more."
