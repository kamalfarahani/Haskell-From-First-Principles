    "### `let ... in` expression\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, the `let` expression is used to define local variables within a block of code. It allows you to introduce new variables and bind them to values that are only visible within the scope of that block. This is particularly useful when you want to compute intermediate values or avoid repeating computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax of a `let` expression is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "let <bindings> in <expression>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `<bindings>` represents one or more variable bindings, and `<expression>` is the expression where the variables are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define multiple variables with a `let` expression, you can separate the bindings with semicolons (;) or put each binding on a new line. Let's look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "let x = 5\n",
    "    y = 10\n",
    "    z = x + y\n",
    "in z * 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define three variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. The values of `x` and `y` are 5 and 10, respectively. The value of `z` is the sum of `x` and `y`, which is 15. Finally, the `in` keyword indicates that the result of the `let` expression is `z * 2` (30 in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use pattern matching in `let` expressions to define multiple variables simultaneously. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "let (x, y) = (5, 10)\n",
    "    z = x + y\n",
    "in z * 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we're using pattern matching to bind the values 5 and 10 to variables `x` and `y`, respectively. The rest of the expression is the same as the previous example.\n",
    "\n",
    "> It's important to note that the scope of the variables defined in a `let` expression is limited to the expression following the `in` keyword. They are not visible outside of that block."

    "### `where` clause\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, the `where` clause is another way to define local variables within a block of code. It allows you to introduce new variables that are scoped to a specific function or pattern matching clause. The `where` clause is typically used at the end of a function definition.\n",

    "The general syntax of a `where` clause is as follows:\n",

    "  where\n",
    "    sum = x + y\n",
    "    product = x * y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a function `sumAndProduct` that takes two integers `x` and `y` as arguments and returns a tuple containing their sum and product. The local variables `sum` and `product` are defined within the `where` clause. The value of `sum` is the sum of `x` and `y`, and the value of `product` is the product of `x` and `y`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Anonymous functions in Haskell (also known as lambda functions) are functions that are defined without being explicitly given a name. They provide a compact and flexible way to create functions on the fly, often used as arguments to higher-order functions or as temporary shortcuts.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "\n",

    "   ```haskell\n",
    "   \\x -> x + 2   -- A function that adds 2 to its argument\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "### Pattern matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern matching is a fundamental feature of Haskell that allows you to destructure and match values against specific patterns. It enables you to define functions and expressions based on different patterns of input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of pattern matching in Haskell with some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Pattern Matching:**\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "factorial :: Int -> Int\n",
    "factorial 0 = 1\n",
    "factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we define the factorial function using pattern matching. The first line specifies the base case where the input is 0, resulting in a factorial of 1. The second line is a recursive definition that matches any other value of `n` and calculates the factorial by multiplying `n` with the factorial of `n-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **List Pattern Matching:**\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "sumList :: [Int] -> Int\n",
    "sumList [] = 0\n",
    "sumList (x:xs) = x + sumList xs\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we define a function `sumList` that calculates the sum of a list of integers. The first line matches an empty list `[]` and returns 0. The second line uses list pattern matching to split the input list into its head `x` and tail `xs`. It recursively calculates the sum by adding the head `x` to the sum of the remaining list `xs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tuple Pattern Matching:**\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "getCoordinates :: (Int, Int) -> (Int, Int)\n",
    "getCoordinates (x, y) = (y, x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we define a function `getCoordinates` that swaps the coordinates of a 2D point. The input is a tuple `(x, y)`, and the pattern `(x, y)` deconstructs the tuple into its components. The function then constructs a new tuple `(y, x)` by swapping the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Wildcard Pattern:**\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "isFirstElementZero :: [Int] -> Bool\n",
    "isFirstElementZero (0:_) = True\n",
    "isFirstElementZero _ = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, the function `isFirstElementZero` checks if the first element of a list is zero. The pattern `(0:_)` matches a list that starts with zero, and the wildcard `_` is used to ignore the rest of the list. If the pattern matches, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the second line with the wildcard `_` matches any other list and returns `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **<span style=\"color:red\">Note:</span>** The order of pattern matches matters!\n",
    "\n",
    "The following version of the function will always return False because it will match the “anything else” case first - and match it to everything - so nothing will get through that to match with the pattern you do want to match:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "isItTwo :: Integer -> Bool\n",
    "isItTwo _ = False\n",
    "isItTwo 2 = True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "### Case Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, the `case` expression is a powerful construct that allows you to pattern match and perform different computations based on the value of an expression. It is often used as an alternative to defining functions using pattern matching on function arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax of a `case` expression is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "case expression of\n",
    "  pattern1 -> result1\n",
    "  pattern2 -> result2\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "  patternN -> resultN\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `expression` is the value to be pattern matched, and each `pattern` is a specific form that the value can take. The right-hand side of each arrow (`->`) represents the computation to be performed when the corresponding pattern matches. The `case` expression evaluates to the result of the computation corresponding to the first matching pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the usage of `case` expression in Haskell. Let's define a function called `dayOfWeek` that takes an integer representing a day of the week (1-7) and returns the corresponding name of the day:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "dayOfWeek :: Int -> String\n",
    "dayOfWeek day =\n",
    "  case day of\n",
    "    1 -> \"Sunday\"\n",
    "    2 -> \"Monday\"\n",
    "    3 -> \"Tuesday\"\n",
    "    4 -> \"Wednesday\"\n",
    "    5 -> \"Thursday\"\n",
    "    6 -> \"Friday\"\n",
    "    7 -> \"Saturday\"\n",
    "    _ -> \"Invalid day\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we match the value of `day` against different patterns (1-7), and return the corresponding day of the week as a string. If the value doesn't match any of the patterns, we use the `_` pattern as a catch-all and return \"Invalid day\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use more complex patterns in `case` expressions, including nested patterns, guards, and variable bindings. Here's another example that demonstrates a more involved `case` expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "data Shape = Circle Double | Rectangle Double Double\n",
    "\n",
    "area :: Shape -> Double\n",
    "area shape =\n",
    "  case shape of\n",
    "    Circle radius -> pi * radius * radius\n",
    "    Rectangle width height -> width * height\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a data type `Shape` with two constructors: `Circle` takes a `Double` representing the radius, and `Rectangle` takes two `Double` values representing the width and height. The `area` function calculates the area of the shape by pattern matching on the `shape` argument. If the shape is a `Circle`, we compute the area using the formula for a circle. If it's a `Rectangle`, we calculate the area by multiplying the width and height."

    "Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. The `flip` function is a classic example of a higher-order function in Haskell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `flip` function takes a binary function as its argument and returns a new function that has the arguments flipped. Here's an example to illustrate how `flip` works:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "-- A binary function that subtracts its second argument from its first argument\n",
    "subtractNumbers :: Int -> Int -> Int\n",
    "subtractNumbers x y = x - y\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Using the `flip` function\n",
    "flippedSubtract :: Int -> Int -> Int\n",
    "flippedSubtract = flip subtractNumbers\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Calling the flipped function\n",
    "result :: Int\n",
    "result = flippedSubtract 5 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have a binary function `subtractNumbers` that subtracts the second argument from the first argument. We want to create a new function that subtracts the first argument from the second argument instead. The `flip` function helps us achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "By calling `flip subtractNumbers`, we obtain a new function `flippedSubtract` where the arguments are flipped. So, calling `flippedSubtract 5 10` will subtract `5` from `10`, resulting in `-5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `flip` function is a higher-order function because it takes a function (`subtractNumbers`) as an argument and returns a new function (`flippedSubtract`). It demonstrates how higher-order functions can be used to create new functions by manipulating existing functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `flip` function is a powerful tool in Haskell and is commonly used for function composition and currying. It allows you to write more expressive and concise code by transforming and reusing existing functions in different contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Associativity in function types definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, function type declarations follow the rule of **right associativity**. This means that when writing a function type with multiple arguments, the function application associates to the right. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a function type with three arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "f :: a -> b -> c -> d\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be interpreted in two ways, depending on the order of function application:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Left-associative interpretation (incorrect):**\n",
    "   `(a -> b) -> c -> d`\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this interpretation, the function first takes an argument of type `a` and returns a function that takes an argument of type `b`. This resulting function then takes an argument of type `c` and returns a value of type `d`. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Right-associative interpretation (correct):**\n",
    "   `a -> (b -> (c -> d))`\n",
    "\n",
    "   This is the correct interpretation due to right associativity. Here's the breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The function takes an argument of type `a`.\n",
    "   * It returns a function that takes an argument of type `b`.\n",
    "   * This inner function then takes an argument of type `c` and returns a value of type `d`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "addTen :: Int -> Int -> Int\n",
    "addTen x y = x + (10 + y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `addTen` takes two integer arguments (`x` and `y`). Due to right associativity, the expression is evaluated like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add 10 to `y`.\n",
    "2. Add the result of step 1 to `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, `addTen 5 3` will be evaluated as `5 + (10 + 3)`, resulting in 18.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points to remember:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Function type declarations in Haskell are right-associative.\n",
    "* Parentheses can be used to override the default associativity if needed for clarity.\n",
    "* Understanding associativity helps write clear and unambiguous function types.\n"

    "### Guards\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, guards are a way to specify conditional expressions or patterns in function definitions. They allow you to define different behavior for different cases based on conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guards are usually associated with function definitions and are placed after the function name and its parameters, using the pipe symbol (|) to separate the different cases. Each case is defined with a condition and a corresponding expression. The condition is a Boolean expression, and the expression is evaluated if the condition is true. If none of the conditions are true, an error may occur, or a default case can be provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of a function that uses guards to define different behavior based on the value of its parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "absolute :: Int -> Int\n",
    "absolute x\n",
    "  | x >= 0    = x\n",
    "  | otherwise = -x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the function `absolute` takes an integer `x` as a parameter. There are two guards defined for this function. The first guard, `x >= 0`, checks if `x` is greater than or equal to zero. If this condition is true, the function returns `x`. The second guard, `otherwise`, is a catch-all case that matches any value. If none of the previous conditions are true, the function returns `-x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guards can also be used with pattern matching. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "factorial :: Int -> Int\n",
    "factorial n\n",
    "  | n == 0    = 1\n",
    "  | otherwise = n * factorial (n - 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the function `factorial` calculates the factorial of a number. The first guard, `n == 0`, checks if `n` is equal to zero. If true, it returns 1, indicating the base case for the factorial. The second guard, `otherwise`, is used to define the recursive case. It multiplies `n` by the factorial of `n-1` and returns the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guards provide a concise and readable way to define conditional behavior in Haskell functions. They are a powerful tool for expressing different cases and handling different conditions within a single function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **<span style=\"color:red\">Note:</span>** Guards always evaluate sequentially, so your guards should be ordered from the case that is most restrictive to the case that is least restrictive."

    "### Function composition\n",
    "\n",
    "The function composition operator, denoted by `(.)`, is a powerful tool in Haskell for combining functions. It allows you to chain multiple functions together, where the output of one function becomes the input for the next. Here's a breakdown of function composition with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `f`: Takes an argument of type `a` and returns a value of type `b`.\n",
    "* `g`: Takes an argument of type `c` and returns a value of type `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function composition allows you to create a new function that applies `f` and then `g` in a single step. Here's the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "h = f . g\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This reads as \"h is equal to f composed with g\". The function `h` takes an argument of type `c` (the input type of `g`) and returns a value of type `a` (the output type of `f`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "double :: Num a => a -> a\n",
    "double x = x * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "addFive :: Num a => a -> a\n",
    "addFive x = x + 5\n",
    "\n",
    "doubleAndAddFive = double . addFive  -- Function composition\n",
    "\n",
    "result = doubleAndAddFive 3\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Breakdown:\n",
    "-- 1. addFive(3) = 3 + 5 = 8\n",
    "-- 2. double(8) = 8 * 2 = 16\n",
    "-- result will be 16\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `doubleAndAddFive` is a new function created by composing `double` and `addFive`. It first adds 5 to the input and then doubles the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Function composition requires the output type of the first function (`f`) to match the input type of the second function (`g`).\n",
    "* The order of composition matters. `f . g` applies `f` first and then `g`.\n",
    "* Function composition promotes code conciseness and readability for chained operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Function composition can be chained further to create even more complex operations. For example, `tripleAndAddTen = triple . (addTen .) . double` would first double a number, then add 10, and finally triple the result.\n",
    "* Parentheses can be used for clarity, especially when composing multiple functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding function composition, you can write more expressive and modular Haskell code, making your programs easier to understand and maintain."

    "### Pointfree Style\n",
    "\n",
    "Pointfree style, also known as tacit programming or combinatorial style, is a programming paradigm where functions are defined without explicitly referring to their arguments. Instead, the functions are expressed as compositions of other functions, often using higher-order functions such as `map`, `filter`, and `fold`. Pointfree style is particularly prevalent in the Haskell programming language, which strongly supports functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In pointfree style, you write functions in terms of other functions and function combinators, rather than explicitly mentioning the arguments. This can lead to more concise and declarative code, as it emphasizes function composition and reusable abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example to illustrate pointfree style in Haskell. Suppose we have a list of integers and we want to calculate the sum of their squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of calculating the sum of squares in a non-pointfree style:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "sumOfSquares :: [Int] -> Int\n",
    "sumOfSquares xs = sum (map (\\x -> x * x) xs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a function `sumOfSquares` that takes a list `xs` as an argument. We use `map` to square each element of `xs` and then use `sum` to calculate the sum of the resulting list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's rewrite the same function in pointfree style:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "sumOfSquares :: [Int] -> Int\n",
    "sumOfSquares = sum . map (\\x -> x * x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this pointfree version, we remove the explicit mention of the `xs` argument. Instead, we express the function as the composition of `sum` and `map (\\x -> x * x)`. The `.` operator composes two functions, and the resulting function takes a list as its argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that the pointfree version is more concise and focuses on the composition of functions, making it easier to reason about and potentially easier to reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pointfree style can be particularly powerful when working with higher-order functions. Here's an example where we want to find the sum of the lengths of all words in a list of strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "sumWordLengths :: [String] -> Int\n",
    "sumWordLengths = sum . map length\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use `map length` to apply the `length` function to each element of the list of strings, and then we use `sum` to calculate the sum of the resulting list of lengths. Again, we express the function without explicitly mentioning the input list argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while pointfree style can make code more concise and elegant, it's not always appropriate or necessary. Sometimes, using explicit arguments can make code more readable and easier to understand, especially for complex or heavily branching logic. Therefore, it's important to strike a balance and choose the appropriate style based on the specific requirements and context of your code."
