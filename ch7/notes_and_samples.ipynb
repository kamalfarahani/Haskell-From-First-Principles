    "### `let ... in` expression\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, the `let` expression is used to define local variables within a block of code. It allows you to introduce new variables and bind them to values that are only visible within the scope of that block. This is particularly useful when you want to compute intermediate values or avoid repeating computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax of a `let` expression is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "let <bindings> in <expression>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `<bindings>` represents one or more variable bindings, and `<expression>` is the expression where the variables are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define multiple variables with a `let` expression, you can separate the bindings with semicolons (;) or put each binding on a new line. Let's look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "let x = 5\n",
    "    y = 10\n",
    "    z = x + y\n",
    "in z * 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define three variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. The values of `x` and `y` are 5 and 10, respectively. The value of `z` is the sum of `x` and `y`, which is 15. Finally, the `in` keyword indicates that the result of the `let` expression is `z * 2` (30 in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use pattern matching in `let` expressions to define multiple variables simultaneously. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "let (x, y) = (5, 10)\n",
    "    z = x + y\n",
    "in z * 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we're using pattern matching to bind the values 5 and 10 to variables `x` and `y`, respectively. The rest of the expression is the same as the previous example.\n",
    "\n",
    "> It's important to note that the scope of the variables defined in a `let` expression is limited to the expression following the `in` keyword. They are not visible outside of that block."

    "### `where` clause\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, the `where` clause is another way to define local variables within a block of code. It allows you to introduce new variables that are scoped to a specific function or pattern matching clause. The `where` clause is typically used at the end of a function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax of a `where` clause is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "<function definition> where <bindings>\n",

    "  where\n",
    "    sum = x + y\n",
    "    product = x * y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a function `sumAndProduct` that takes two integers `x` and `y` as arguments and returns a tuple containing their sum and product. The local variables `sum` and `product` are defined within the `where` clause. The value of `sum` is the sum of `x` and `y`, and the value of `product` is the product of `x` and `y`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Anonymous functions in Haskell (also known as lambda functions) are functions that are defined without being explicitly given a name. They provide a compact and flexible way to create functions on the fly, often used as arguments to higher-order functions or as temporary shortcuts.\n",

    "* **`expression`:** The body of the function that defines what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single argument:**\n",
    "   ```haskell\n",
    "   \\x -> x + 2   -- A function that adds 2 to its argument\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",

    "### Pattern matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern matching is a fundamental feature of Haskell that allows you to destructure and match values against specific patterns. It enables you to define functions and expressions based on different patterns of input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of pattern matching in Haskell with some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Pattern Matching:**\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "factorial :: Int -> Int\n",
    "factorial 0 = 1\n",
    "factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we define the factorial function using pattern matching. The first line specifies the base case where the input is 0, resulting in a factorial of 1. The second line is a recursive definition that matches any other value of `n` and calculates the factorial by multiplying `n` with the factorial of `n-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **List Pattern Matching:**\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "sumList :: [Int] -> Int\n",
    "sumList [] = 0\n",
    "sumList (x:xs) = x + sumList xs\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we define a function `sumList` that calculates the sum of a list of integers. The first line matches an empty list `[]` and returns 0. The second line uses list pattern matching to split the input list into its head `x` and tail `xs`. It recursively calculates the sum by adding the head `x` to the sum of the remaining list `xs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tuple Pattern Matching:**\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "getCoordinates :: (Int, Int) -> (Int, Int)\n",
    "getCoordinates (x, y) = (y, x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we define a function `getCoordinates` that swaps the coordinates of a 2D point. The input is a tuple `(x, y)`, and the pattern `(x, y)` deconstructs the tuple into its components. The function then constructs a new tuple `(y, x)` by swapping the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Wildcard Pattern:**\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "isFirstElementZero :: [Int] -> Bool\n",
    "isFirstElementZero (0:_) = True\n",
    "isFirstElementZero _ = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, the function `isFirstElementZero` checks if the first element of a list is zero. The pattern `(0:_)` matches a list that starts with zero, and the wildcard `_` is used to ignore the rest of the list. If the pattern matches, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the second line with the wildcard `_` matches any other list and returns `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **<span style=\"color:red\">Note:</span>** The order of pattern matches matters!\n",
    "\n",
    "The following version of the function will always return False because it will match the “anything else” case first - and match it to everything - so nothing will get through that to match with the pattern you do want to match:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "isItTwo :: Integer -> Bool\n",
    "isItTwo _ = False\n",
    "isItTwo 2 = True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "### Case Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, the `case` expression is a powerful construct that allows you to pattern match and perform different computations based on the value of an expression. It is often used as an alternative to defining functions using pattern matching on function arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax of a `case` expression is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "case expression of\n",
    "  pattern1 -> result1\n",
    "  pattern2 -> result2\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "  patternN -> resultN\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `expression` is the value to be pattern matched, and each `pattern` is a specific form that the value can take. The right-hand side of each arrow (`->`) represents the computation to be performed when the corresponding pattern matches. The `case` expression evaluates to the result of the computation corresponding to the first matching pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the usage of `case` expression in Haskell. Let's define a function called `dayOfWeek` that takes an integer representing a day of the week (1-7) and returns the corresponding name of the day:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "dayOfWeek :: Int -> String\n",
    "dayOfWeek day =\n",
    "  case day of\n",
    "    1 -> \"Sunday\"\n",
    "    2 -> \"Monday\"\n",
    "    3 -> \"Tuesday\"\n",
    "    4 -> \"Wednesday\"\n",
    "    5 -> \"Thursday\"\n",
    "    6 -> \"Friday\"\n",
    "    7 -> \"Saturday\"\n",
    "    _ -> \"Invalid day\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we match the value of `day` against different patterns (1-7), and return the corresponding day of the week as a string. If the value doesn't match any of the patterns, we use the `_` pattern as a catch-all and return \"Invalid day\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use more complex patterns in `case` expressions, including nested patterns, guards, and variable bindings. Here's another example that demonstrates a more involved `case` expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "data Shape = Circle Double | Rectangle Double Double\n",
    "\n",
    "area :: Shape -> Double\n",

    "    Circle radius -> pi * radius * radius\n",
    "    Rectangle width height -> width * height\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a data type `Shape` with two constructors: `Circle` takes a `Double` representing the radius, and `Rectangle` takes two `Double` values representing the width and height. The `area` function calculates the area of the shape by pattern matching on the `shape` argument. If the shape is a `Circle`, we compute the area using the formula for a circle. If it's a `Rectangle`, we calculate the area by multiplying the width and height."
