    "### Maybe\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Maybe` type in Haskell is a way to represent optional values. It essentially tells the program that a variable might not have a value at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main parts to `Maybe`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Just a**: This signifies that the `Maybe` type holds an actual value of type `a`. Here, `a` can be any other Haskell type like `Int`, `String`, or even another `Maybe` type.\n",
    "* **Nothing**: This indicates that the `Maybe` type is empty and doesn't hold any value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of `Maybe` as a safe alternative to null pointers found in other languages. It forces you to explicitly handle the possibility of a missing value, preventing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common ways `Maybe` is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Error handling**: Functions can return `Maybe` to indicate successful computation with `Just value` or failure with `Nothing`. \n",
    "* **Data with potential absence**:  Maybe can represent things that might not always be present, like looking up a key in a map that might not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Haskell provides functions to work with `Maybe` values. Some important ones include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `maybe`: This function lets you define a default value to use if the `Maybe` is `Nothing`.\n",
    "* `isJust`: Checks if a `Maybe` value is actually `Just` something.\n",
    "* `isNothing`: Checks if a `Maybe` value is `Nothing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using `Maybe`, you write more robust Haskell code that explicitly deals with the absence of values."

    "### Either\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, the `Either` type represents a value that can be one of two possibilities. It's like a coin with two sides, but instead of heads and tails, it holds two different types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how `Either` works:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Two possibilities**: An `Either` value can be either a `Left a` or a `Right b`. Here, `a` and `b` are any other Haskell types. \n",
    "* **Constructors**: `Left` and `Right` are constructors, like building blocks, that create `Either` values.\n",
    "* **Convention**: By convention, `Left` is used to hold error information (like \"wrong input\") and `Right` holds the successful result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an analogy: Imagine a function that divides two numbers. It can either succeed and return the result (represented by `Right`) or fail because of division by zero (represented by `Left`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about `Either`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Error handling**: Similar to `Maybe`, `Either` is a powerful tool for error handling. Functions can return `Either String Int` (for example), indicating success with `Right 42` (result) or failure with `Left \"Division by zero\"` (error message).\n",
    "* **Flexible types**: `a` and `b` in `Either a b` can be any type, allowing for different error and result types.\n",
    "* **Pattern matching**: You can use pattern matching to handle different cases of `Either` values. For example, check if it's a `Left` error or a `Right` result and process them accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Either` provides a structured way to represent computations that might fail. It keeps your code clean and avoids errors by forcing you to explicitly deal with both success and failure scenarios."

    "### Lifted and Unlifted Kinds\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, lifted and unlifted kinds refer to how a type behaves in terms of evaluation and laziness. Here's a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lifted Kinds**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Represent types that can hold the special value `bottom`.\n",
    "* `bottom` signifies a computation that hasn't finished, might be undefined, or throws an exception.\n",
    "* This makes lifted types lazy by default. Evaluation happens only when the value is absolutely needed.\n",
    "* Examples: `Maybe a`, `List a` (standard list type).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unlifted Kinds**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Represent types that cannot hold `bottom`.\n",
    "* Values are always in a defined state and ready for use.\n",
    "* Evaluation happens eagerly, as soon as the expression is encountered.\n",
    "* Types of kind `#` (unlifted) are often native machine types and raw pointers.\n",
    "* Unlifted types can be faster due to the lack of laziness overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Evaluation:** Lifted types are lazy, unlifted are eager.\n",
    "* **`bottom`:** Lifted types can contain `bottom`, unlifted cannot.\n",
    "* **Performance:** Unlifted types can be potentially faster due to eager evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Kind refers to the type of a type. It defines what kind of values a type can hold.\n",
    "* There are extensions in Haskell (like `data-elevator`) to convert lifted types to unlifted for specific use cases.\n",
    "* Unlifted types are not the same as strict data types (wrapped in `Strict`). Strict data types ensure a value is evaluated, but they can still be lifted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding lifted and unlifted kinds helps you reason about program behavior, performance, and memory usage in Haskell.\n"
