    "### Qualified Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, qualified imports are a way to manage how you use functions and data types from other modules in your code. They help prevent naming conflicts and improve code readability. Here's how they work with some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Use Qualified Imports?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Disambiguating Names:** Imagine two modules provide functions with the same name. By qualifying the import, you add a prefix to the function name, making it clear which module it comes from.\n",
    "* **Readability:** For commonly used modules with long names, qualified imports with short aliases can improve code clarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "import qualified ModuleName as Alias\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ModuleName`: This is the actual name of the module you want to import.\n",
    "* `Alias`: This is a shorter name you choose to use for the module in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1: Disambiguation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you're using modules `System.IO` and `Data.List`, both of which have a function named `head`. Here's how to avoid conflict:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "import qualified System.IO as IO  -- Import with alias IO\n",
    "import qualified Data.List as List -- Import with alias List\n",
    "\n",
    "main = do\n",
    "  putStrLn (IO.head \"Hello World!\")  -- Use IO.head for System.IO\n",
    "  print (List.head [1, 2, 3])        -- Use List.head for Data.List\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2: Readability with Aliases**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Data.Text` module is commonly used for text manipulation. Here's how to import it with a shorter alias:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "import qualified Data.Text as Text\n",
    "\n",
    "myText = Text.pack \"This is some text\"\n",
    "formattedText = Text.upper myText\n",
    "\n",
    "-- More readable than using Data.Text.pack, etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Import Selectively:** Don't import entire modules with `import qualified ...`. Instead, choose specific functions and data types you need. This keeps your code cleaner and avoids potential conflicts with functions you're not using.\n",
    "* **Descriptive Aliases:** Choose clear and descriptive aliases for frequently used modules. This improves code readability for yourself and others.\n",
    "* **Balance Readability and Verbosity:** While aliases can improve readability, avoid overly short or cryptic ones. Aim for a balance that keeps code clear without sacrificing clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these tips, you can effectively use qualified imports to manage dependencies and write cleaner, more maintainable Haskell code."

    "- `stack`: This is the executable for the Haskell Stack tool.\n",
    "- `new`: This is a subcommand of `stack` used specifically for creating new projects.\n",
    "- `project`: This is the name you're giving to your new project. Make sure it follows the naming guidelines for Haskell projects (alphanumeric characters, hyphens, etc.).\n",
    "- `simple`: This is the optional flag that specifies the template to be used. By default, `stack new` uses the \"new-template\" which includes libraries and testing functionalities. However, the \"simple\" template provides a more basic structure without those extras. \n",

    "Using the \"simple\" template is suitable for smaller projects where you don't need the full functionality of the default template. It creates a project structure with minimal files, making it easier to manage for quick and focused development.\n"
